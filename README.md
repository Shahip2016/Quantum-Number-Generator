# Quantum-Number-Generator
quantum random number generators set up a superposition on one or more qubits using the Hadamard gate. This gate moves qubits from the 0 state to an equal superposition of the 0 and 1 state, meaning that youâ€™re equally likely to measure a qubit value of 0 or 1 at the end of the quantum circuit. If you treat a string of qubits as a binary value (1111 = 15, for example), then applying a Hadamard gate to every qubit and then making a measurement will generate a random bitstring, and therefore a random number. You can use this random number wherever randomness is required; for example, by creating a bot that tells random Quantum Dad Jokes
